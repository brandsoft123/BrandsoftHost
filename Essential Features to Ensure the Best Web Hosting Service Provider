malware scanning, SSL certificates, and regular backups. They should also offer secure FTP access, DDoS protection, and proactive monitoring to safeguard your website 
against potential threats.

offer one-click installations of popular applications like WordPress.

Regular backups are crucial to safeguard your website's data. Look for cloud web hosting services that offer automated backup solutions, allowing you to schedule 
backups and easily restore your website if any data loss or system failure occurs. It's advantageous if the provider also implements backup redundancy by storing 
backups in multiple locations for added security.
